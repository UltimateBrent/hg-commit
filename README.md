# hg-commit package

The Hg-Commit package is a simple utility to replace switching to a full mercurial client for incremental commits. If you work on webpages and commit to see changes, this can greatly improve your workflow. This is *not* a mercurial client replacement. You'll still need one to manage different repos, pull, merge etc.
